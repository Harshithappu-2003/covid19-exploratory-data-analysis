# COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on the COVID-19 pandemic. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, we analyze global COVID-19 case trends and vaccination distributions to extract insights that can help understand the impact of the virus and the efficiency of global health responses.

## üìä Project Description

This project performs data wrangling, cleaning, visualization, and insight generation from publicly available COVID-19 datasets. It provides a comprehensive overview of the pandemic trends through various stages and helps in identifying correlations between case numbers and vaccination rates.

## üîç Features

- Analysis of global COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- Comparative visualizations across countries and continents.
- Vaccine distribution analysis by region.
- Correlation and trend identification using seaborn and matplotlib.
- Time-series analysis with animated plots and line graphs.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of large datasets (.csv and .xlsx).

## üìÇ Datasets Used

1. **COVID_EDA.ipynb** ‚Äî Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step analysis and visualizations.
2. **COVID_VACCINATIONS.csv** (~50 MB) ‚Äî Contains vaccination data from around the world.
3. **COVID_GLOBAL_CASES.xlsx** (~33 MB) ‚Äî Includes confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries by country and date.
